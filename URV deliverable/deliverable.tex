\section{Introduction}

A virus encodes one or more proteases which are enzymes that spur the formation of new protein products, thus play crucial roles in virus replication ,
and are important targets for the design and development of potent antiviral agents or drugs.
Binding affinity is the strength of the binding interaction between a single biomolecule (e.g., a virus protein) to its ligand or binding partner (e.g., a drug).
it is a key to appreciating the intermolecular interactions driving biological processes and measured as part of the drug discovery process to help design drugs that bind their targets selectively and specifically.
